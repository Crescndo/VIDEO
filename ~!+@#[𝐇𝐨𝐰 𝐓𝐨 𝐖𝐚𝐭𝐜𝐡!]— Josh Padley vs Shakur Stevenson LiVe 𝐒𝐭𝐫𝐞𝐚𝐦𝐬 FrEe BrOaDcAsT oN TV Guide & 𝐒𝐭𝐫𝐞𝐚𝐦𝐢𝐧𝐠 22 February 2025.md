In what is a really quick turnaround from the first fight last October, Beterbiev snuck a tight majority decision after scorecards of 115-113, 116-112 and 114-114. The 38-year-old came on strong down the stretch, his constant forward pressure doing enough to become the first undisputed light heavyweight champions since the great Roy Jones Jr from 1999 to 2002. The gameplan to cut off the ring worked, but the Russian-Canadian will want to correct a tendency to fall over his front foot for a repeat.

There's the odd boxing sage who still thinks Bivol edged the first fight after a strong start in which he landed the better shots. Though becoming the first fighter to take the unbeaten Beterbiev the distance, Bivol will want to correct walking back in straight lines and a lack of forward pressure that cost him four month ago. A previous victor over Canelo Alvarez, the 34-year-old is desperate for revenge to set up a probable trilogy.

“I'm better now than I was in the first fight," Beterbiev said earlier this week. "We've done different things in training that I couldn't do back then."

"I feel less pressure than before,” said Bivol, who started the first fight as favorite. “I didn't like my performance [last time]. I didn't do enough. I can do more, I know it. I could have been a 100% winner. I want to do it with no doubts.”
