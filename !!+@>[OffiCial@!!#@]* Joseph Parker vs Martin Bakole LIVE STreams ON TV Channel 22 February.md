Uncrowned has Artur Beterbiev vs. Dmitry Bivol 2 live results, round-by-round updates, highlights, ring walks and start time for the Beterbiev vs. Bivol 2 fight card on Saturday at the Anb Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Undisputed light heavyweight champion Beterbiev defends his WBA, WBO, IBF, and WBC belts against the former WBA champion Bivol in a hotly-anticipated title rematch, which sits atop a card that is being declared by some as the best in boxing history.

Beterbiev (21-0, 20 KOs) and Bivol (23-1, 12 KOs) delivered a tremendous contest in their undisputed championship clash this past October in Riyadh. On that occasion, Beterbiev edged a controversial majority decision over Bivol, with the majority of viewers both at home and in the arena feeling that Bivol had done enough to have his hand raised at the end of 12 electric rounds

As a result, Beterbiev and Bivol meet in an immediate rematch for all four belts on Saturday.
